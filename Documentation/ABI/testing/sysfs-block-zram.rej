-Description:
-		The notify_free file is read-only. Depending on device usage
-		scenario it may account a) the number of pages freed because
-		of swap slot free notifications or b) the number of pages freed
-		because of REQ_DISCARD requests sent by bio. The former ones
-		are sent to a swap block device when a swap slot is freed, which
-		implies that this disk is being used as a swap disk. The latter
-		ones are sent by filesystem mounted with discard option,
-		whenever some data blocks are getting discarded.
