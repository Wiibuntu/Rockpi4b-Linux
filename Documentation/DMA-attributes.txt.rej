+DMA_ATTR_ALLOC_SINGLE_PAGES
+------------------------
+
+This is a hint to the DMA-mapping subsystem that it's probably not worth
+the time to try to allocate memory to in a way that gives better TLB
+efficiency (AKA it's not worth trying to build the mapping out of larger
+pages).  You might want to specify this if:
+- You know that the accesses to this memory won't thrash the TLB.
+  You might know that the accesses are likely to be sequential or
+  that they aren't sequential but it's unlikely you'll ping-pong
+  between many addresses that are likely to be in different physical
+  pages.
+- You know that the penalty of TLB misses while accessing the
+  memory will be small enough to be inconsequential.  If you are
+  doing a heavy operation like decryption or decompression this
+  might be the case.
+- You know that the DMA mapping is fairly transitory.  If you expect
+  the mapping to have a short lifetime then it may be worth it to
+  optimize allocation (avoid coming up with large pages) instead of
+  getting the slight performance win of larger pages.
+Setting this hint doesn't guarantee that you won't get huge pages, but it
+means that we won't try quite as hard to get them.
