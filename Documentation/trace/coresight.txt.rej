+How to use the STM module
+-------------------------
+
+Using the System Trace Macrocell module is the same as the tracers - the only
+difference is that clients are driving the trace capture rather
+than the program flow through the code.
+
+As with any other CoreSight component, specifics about the STM tracer can be
+found in sysfs with more information on each entry being found in [1]:
+
+root@genericarmv8:~# ls /sys/bus/coresight/devices/20100000.stm
+enable_source   hwevent_select  port_enable     subsystem       uevent
+hwevent_enable  mgmt            port_select     traceid
+root@genericarmv8:~#
+
+Like any other source a sink needs to be identified and the STM enabled before
+being used:
+
+root@genericarmv8:~# echo 1 > /sys/bus/coresight/devices/20010000.etf/enable_sink
+root@genericarmv8:~# echo 1 > /sys/bus/coresight/devices/20100000.stm/enable_source
+
+From there user space applications can request and use channels using the devfs
+interface provided for that purpose by the generic STM API:
+
+root@genericarmv8:~# ls -l /dev/20100000.stm
+crw-------    1 root     root       10,  61 Jan  3 18:11 /dev/20100000.stm
+root@genericarmv8:~#
+
+Details on how to use the generic STM API can be found here [2].
